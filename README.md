# Assignment 1

This repository contains solutions to a set of C++ programming problems. Each program is implemented using C++ concepts and well-commented.

## File Descriptions

### 1. `1addition.cpp`
- **Description:** Adds two big numbers (up to 4098 digits) using character arrays. Implements a `BigNumberAdder` class with input, addition, and output methods.

### 2. `2nthLargest.cpp`
- **Description:** Finds the Nth largest element in an array using a class and STL `vector`. Includes bounds checking for N.

### 3. `3unique.cpp`
- **Description:** Prints all unique elements from an array using a class and STL `vector`.

### 4. `4merge.cpp`
- **Description:** Merges two arrays of different sizes and sorts the merged array in ascending or descending order based on user input. Uses a class and STL `vector`.

### 5. `5bst_array.cpp`
- **Description:** Implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) using an array. Supports insertion, deletion, and traversals (inorder, preorder, postorder) via an `ArrayBST` class.

## Compilation Notes
- All programs are standard C++ and should compile with any modern C++ compiler.
- No external libraries are required.
- **How to run:**
  ```sh
  g++ file_name.cpp -o file_name
  ./file_name
  ```

## Special Notes
- All code is well-commented for clarity and future maintenance.
- Each program is self-contained and can be compiled and run independently.
- All programs have implemented OOPs.
